# Quantum Credit Card Fraud Detection

This is a simple quantum fraud detection system built using a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) in PyTorch and Pennylane. It predicts whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent based on several features using quantum machine learning.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-fraud-detection.git
   cd quantum-fraud-detection
